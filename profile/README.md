## Open source

At Lectra, Free & Open-Source Software has been used for a long time, but now represents most of the technologies used in the context of the Lectra 4.0 offers.

We had defined a FOSS Policy to manage the use of open source project inside our offers.

We embrace the innovation mindset of open source projects into some internal project as inner source project.
And then after some incubation time we decide to make some of them visible as open source projects in this Github organisation.
